## Video Contributors 

Each chapter will have 3-8 sections, roughly corresponding to the book.

**Goal.** The purpose of the video is to provide an interactive experience, where learners can review the main ideas of the book.

**Learning Objectives**

*  Start each section with a set of 3 or 4 learning objectives.
*  For each section, the video will reinforce the learning objectives. It is okay to use the learning objectives from the text. Then, the video will provide exactly the information needed for the learner to complete the interactive exercises.

**Background of Viewers.** You can assume that the viewer will have read the text. However, just as students in your classes, they will probably have forgotten the substance. So, big points need to be reinforced.

**Relationship with Tutorials**

*  As part of the purpose of the video is to provide background for the tutorials, there will need to be close co-ordination between the two.
*  Sometimes a video can provide a complicated analysis of a data set and then the tutorial can ask the learner to go through essentially the same analysis albeit with modifications.
*  Many of the overheads will provide a combination of code and output from the code. Explain this to the viewer in a way that he or she can reproduce it in a related situation.

**Video Overheads**

*  Use whatever system you like (e.g., latex/beamer, Powerpoint) to produce the video overheads in .pdf format.
*  If you are indifferent, try `R markdown` (that uses latex/Beamer), as in the [Chapter 1 Example](https://github.com/OpenActTextDev/LDACourse1/tree/main/Overheads). As this integrates well with our online delivery software (R markdown/Bookdown), this will probably become the standard later on as we develop protocols to replicate our work for other courses.


**Video Production**

*  Everyone does this differently, but one approach is to write out the scripts of what you want to say prior to the recording. [Here](https://github.com/OpenActTextDev/LDACourse1/tree/main/Overheads/LDA1.Chap1.OverheadScripts) are some examples for Chapter 1 of the first course. This makes the first draft much longer but becomes more time efficient for those of us who require multiple drafts to get a good quality video. Think of about 1000 words for an 8 minute video.
*  A bonus of writing the scripts in advance is that they may be useful when we decide how we wish to add close-captioning to the videos (really useful for international audiences).
*  Use whatever recording system that you like. If you do not have experience in this, one easily accessible avenue is to use Zoom's ability to record. This is how the Frees examples in Chapter 1 were done. 


## Tutorial Problem Contributors

For each section, the goal is to have one or two tutorial exercises that will reinforce learning objectives of the section.

**Assignment Text**. Start with a set of background information known as the assignment text. This is relatively brief. For example, Datacamp recommends 540 characters with a target range of 30 to 780 characters.

**Instructions**. Next comes a set of instructions, typically written in a bullet fashion where each bullet corresponds to a part. 

*  The target is for three parts but this may range from 1 to 4
*  For each part, the ideal is 360 characters with a target range of 30 to 480 characters.

**Hints** may also be provided. Again they should be short (about 270 characters) and there may be from 0 to 4 hints per exercise.

**Solution Code**. Provide the `R` code that solves the problem described in the assignment text and instructions.

**Sample Code**. Copy the solution code and remove selected variables and function names that you think users would learn from filling in. Consider a range of 8-12 lines of code but feel free to deviate to accomplish learning objectives.

**Success Messages**. Give one to three lines providing encouragement for users and summarizing what they have learned in this exercise.

### Datacamp Light

Tutorial problem contributors do not need to get into the online tutorial system. Just simply provide the problem set-up (assignment and instructions) and the `R`-code solutions and sample code, with hints and success messages as added plusses. However, if you would like to learn more, see the following.

**Datacamp Light URLs**. To get a better sense as to how the software makes this happen, start with the foundations of [DataCamp Light](https://cdn.datacamp.com/dcl-react-prod/index.html). 

*  It may be that the [source code](https://github.com/datacamp/datacamp-light) can also be helpful.
*  Here is guidance on installing the ["tutorial" package](https://datacamp.github.io/tutorial/) as well as the [Rdrr](https://rdrr.io/cran/tutorial/) version.

Users ultimately want to see a correct solution. If the learner does not get the correct solution, then the Section \@ref(Sec:SCT) **submission correction tests** provide guidance on the source of the mistakes.


### Data 

Many tutorial problems will involve interesting data. You might start with the data in the [Loss Data Analytics](https://openacttexts.github.io/Loss-Data-Analytics/index.html) book as many students will be familiar with them from their reading.

For other datasets, there are a few in the [Regression Modeling with Actuarial and Financial Applications](https://instruction.bus.wisc.edu/jfrees/jfreesbooks/Regression%20Modeling/BookWebDec2010/data.html) book.

In particular, the `R` package [CASdatasets](http://cas.uqam.ca/) has many good choices; this package is based on the book *Computational Actuarial Science with R*.


## Submission Correction Tests Contributors {#Sec:SCT}

These are fairly specialized part of the tutorial system; so, we hope to get one or two volunteers that will focus on this aspect. They provide guidance to users on how to correct commonly occurring mistakes. They are a super helpful part of so-called "intelligent tutoring systems" but may take us awhile to implement properly. 

*  Fortunately, we have an overview that was written by a Wisconsin student. See the description of *DataCamp Light's* [Submission Correctness Tests](https://ewfreesres.github.io/SCT-in-R/index.html).
